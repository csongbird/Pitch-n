# Pitch'n

### The Status Quo
Many charities receive items that are unsuitable for their demographic or
are completely unsuable. In terms of clothing donations, many charities 
recieve clothes that are torn, soiled, or otherwise unusable. 25% of clothing 
donations end up in the landfill. Disposing of these items can cost the charity money
and manpower that they cannot afford to spend, rendering the donation moot. 

### Pitch'n's Purpose

Pitch'n is a application that helps both users and charities meet their needs.
Many organizations prefer monetary donations due to the flexibility of its use, 
however, item donations are still a popular method of donation.

Charitable organizations that are looking for certain types of items can connect to the
app and spread the word regarding what they are looking for and the quality that they 
accept. This helps reduce the flow of unusuable and unsuitable items, saving money and effort.

Individual users of the application can see where their donations would be best recieved
and make the greatest impact. 

> Consider Pitch'n to be like a noticeboard, where charities can post their information in
> one place rather than scattered where people may not find it.
